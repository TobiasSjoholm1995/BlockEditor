When making a release, right click the project and select "Publish".
Choose local folder and then select the Target Runtiem to "Portable".
This make sure that the user dont have to install the .NET Core runtime.

Maybe in the future we can migrate the codebase to .NET 9?
External libraries like SkiaSharp might cause some issues.
