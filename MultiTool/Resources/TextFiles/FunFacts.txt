Fun facts about PR2;

The max block limit was in July 2019 changed from 20k to 50k blocks

The max width of LE is 2 000. To the right you can go 1550 blocks and to the left 450 blocks.

The max height of LE is 2000. Up you can go around 340 blocks and down you can go 1660.

There is a backup of all levels changed on the site:  https://pr2hub.com/backups/
It saves the levels for 50 days.

Setting the max time of a map to 0, makes the time tick upwards instead.

By placing 2 blocks above each other, 1 of the blocks becomes art. (needs to press restart in LE for it to work, only in LE its visible)
